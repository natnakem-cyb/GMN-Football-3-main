# IPPO Credit-Assignment & Lazy-Agent Root Cause Analysis

## Executive Summary
In cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning benchmarks (such as Google Research Football scenarios `academy_3_vs_1_with_keeper`, `5_vs_5`, and `11_vs_11`), Independent PPO (IPPO) exhibits characteristic training degradation, higher gradient variance, and "lazy-agent" pathologies compared to Multi-Agent PPO with a Centralized Critic (MAPPO). This report details the theoretical, mathematical, and architectural root causes of this performance divergence.

## 1. Mathematical Formulation of the Credit-Assignment Deficit

### IPPO Value Function (Decentralized)
In IPPO, each agent $i$ updates its policy using Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) computed from a decentralized local value function:
$$V_i(o_i^t) \approx \mathbb{E}_{\pi} \left[ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r^{t+k} \;\middle|\; o_i^t \right]$$
The resulting temporal difference (TD) error at timestep $t$ is:
$$\delta_i^t = r^t + \gamma V_i(o_i^{t+1}) - V_i(o_i^t)$$

### MAPPO Value Function (Centralized Joint State)
In MAPPO, the centralized critic conditions on the joint observation state $s^t = (o_1^t, o_2^t, \dots, o_N^t)$:
$$V_{\text{joint}}(s^t) \approx \mathbb{E}_{\boldsymbol{\pi}} \left[ \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \gamma^k r_{\text{team}}^{t+k} \;\middle|\; s^t \right]$$
With TD error:
$$\delta_{\text{MAPPO}}^t = r_{\text{team}}^t + \gamma V_{\text{joint}}(s^{t+1}) - V_{\text{joint}}(s^t)$$

## 2. Root Cause Breakdown

### A. Partial Observability and Non-Stationarity
- **The Issue**: In a multi-agent football environment, agent $i$'s local observation $o_i$ contains relative ego-centric coordinates and local teammate vectors. Crucial tactical signals (e.g. whether teammate $j$ has broken through the offside line, goalkeeper positioning, open passing lanes) reside in the global state $s$, not within $o_i$ alone.
- **Consequence for IPPO**: From agent $i$'s perspective, the environment is non-stationary because other agents are learning simultaneously. $V_i(o_i^t)$ attempts to predict team rewards without knowing what teammates are doing, resulting in extreme variance in the value target and noisy advantage estimates $\hat{A}_i^t$.

### B. The "Lazy Agent" Problem
- When team reward is shared (e.g. $+1.0$ for goal), agent $A$ may execute an elite through-ball to agent $B$, who taps the ball into an empty net.
- Under IPPO:
  - Agent $B$ receives positive reinforcement directly at $t_{\text{goal}}$.
  - Agent $A$'s pass occurs at $t_{\text{goal}} - \Delta t$. Over this horizon, the discounted reward $\gamma^{\Delta t} R$ is heavily decayed and blurred by all intervening random actions taken by agents $B$ and $C$.
  - Often, agent $A$ learns that standing still or moving backwards minimizes individual defensive risk, letting agent $B$ do all the work—leading to sub-optimal local equilibria.
- Under MAPPO:
  - $V_{\text{joint}}(s^t)$ observes agent $B$'s unobstructed trajectory the moment agent $A$ plays the pass.
  - The centralized critic immediately elevates $V_{\text{joint}}(s^{t+1})$, generating a strong immediate positive advantage $\hat{A}^t > 0$ for agent $A$ at the exact tick the assist is delivered.

### C. Permutation Invariance & Parameter Scaling
- Standard centralized critics flatten all agent observations into a single dense vector $(N \times D_{\text{obs}})$, which leads to parameter explosion and poor generalization when moving between 3v1 ($3 \times 127 = 381$), 5v5 ($5 \times 127 = 635$), and 11v11 ($11 \times 127 = 1397$).
- **GMN-Football-3 Solution**: We introduced the **Deep Sets Centralized Critic** with permutation-invariant dual aggregation:
  $$\phi(s) = \left[ \frac{1}{N} \sum_{i=1}^N f(o_i), \; \max_{i=1}^N f(o_i) \right]$$
  $$V(s) = g(\phi(s))$$
  This allows $O(1)$ parameter complexity regardless of team size while preserving full permutation equivariance.

## 3. Comparison Summary Matrix

| Metric / Dimension | Independent PPO (IPPO) | Centralized Critic MAPPO (Deep Sets) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |

## 4. Recommendations & Mitigations Applied
1. **Permutation-Invariant Pooling**: Integrated Deep Sets pooling in `mappo_networks.py` so the centralized critic trains effectively across 3v1, 5v5, and 11v11 without retraining flat heads.
2. **Role Differentiation**: Added 12-dimensional one-hot role embeddings to the observation space (`simple115_v3_role`), enabling actors and critics to distinguish wingers, strikers, and midfielders.
3. **Shared Trajectory Buffers**: Maintained unified rollout tensors `(num_steps, num_agents, obs_dim)` in `mappo_rollout.py` to ensure synchronous GAE computation across the team.
